            <p>Hello!</p> 
            <p>I study computer science in Tampere University in the Software, web & cloud -master's degree. I finished my batchelor's degree in the January of 2024, but have started some of my master's studies in the autumn of 2023.</p>
            <p>As minor subjects, I have studied information management and political research, since I'm also interested in managerial and societal topics. As my batchelor's thesis, I wrote about mobile apps in electronic democracy.</p>
