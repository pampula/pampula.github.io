            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello!</p> 
            <p>I study computer science in Tampere University in the Software, 
                web & cloud -Master's degree. I am planning to graduate during 2025/2026 winter.</p>
            <p>As minor subjects, I have studied information management and political 
                research, since I'm also interested in managerial and societal topics. 
                As my batchelor's thesis, I wrote about mobile apps in electronic democracy.</p>
            <p>My strengths include teamworking and writing skills. In a project 
                course, I was in the role of a project manager and it was wonderful 
                to facilitate the group's work.
                On the programming side, I'm good in Java and Android programming, 
                but I am familiar with other languages and technologies aswell. </p>
            <p>I would love to work in a company, where I could improve my fullstack
                skills and be involved with people, perhaps in consulting matters.
            </p>
