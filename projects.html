            <h1>My Projects</h1>
            <p>At the university, I have done several projects and assignments 
                related to a wide variety of topics, which are not all listed here. 
                I have used languages such as Python, C++, Java and JavaScript in them. The two significant school 
                projects are the Software Engineering Project 1 and 2, which 
                are presented below. In addition to school projects and assignments, I have a few projects of my own.</p>

                    <h2>Sanapolku</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://koodikilpparit.github.io/sanapolku/#/" target="_blank">Sanapolku</a> is open souce PWA mobile application for aphasia therapy. It is developed in the Software Engineering Project 2. The app is based in the ACRT therapy method where aphasia patients practice words with the help of images and repetition.</p>
                    <p>I was the project manager for this project and took care of customer, team and coach communication, meetings and the overall picture of the project. In addition, I participated in designing, testing and implementing the app. This included tools like Figma, React and Jest. The challenge of this project was that there was no funding available and the app had to be created with free solutions.</p>

                <div class="project">
                    <h2>Antibiootit.fi</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://antibiootit.fi/" target="_blank">Antibiootit.fi</a> is an antibiotic calculator developed in the Software Engineering Project 1 course for use by healthcare professionals. It calculates the recommended antibiotic dosage based on the diagnosis and the child's weight.</p>
                    <p>In this project, I worked in the backend team, building a REST API for the website, using Java Spring Boot. I also took part in writing unit tests, project documentation and API documentation with Swagger. In addition, I implemented collecting the user inputs in the JavaScript frontend for research purposes.</p>

                <div class="project">
                    <h2>MenstrualApp</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://github.com/pampula/KuukautisApp" target="_blank">MenstrualApp</a> (or KuukautisApp in Finnish) is an Android application originally created for the Mobile development course, but I continued developing it further. It is a minimalistic application for monitoring and predicting menstrual cycles. It is in my active personal use, as the mobile apps in app stores contain too many needles features and ads. The program is written in Java.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="project">
                    <h2>Memory Game</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://github.com/pampula/memorygame" target="_blank">Memory Game</a> is a classic memory game project for refreshing my memory with Qt and C++.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="project">
                    <h2>PomodoroApp</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://github.com/pampula/PomodoroApp" target="_blank">PomodoroApp</a> is a JavaFx desktop application, that provides a simple pomodoro timer for working and studying. It is inspired by the versions found online, but I wanted to have a custom desktop version of my own, that doesn't need internet to work.</p>
