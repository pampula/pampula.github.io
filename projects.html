            <h1>My Projects</h1>
            <p>At the university, I have done several projects and assignments related to a wide variety of topics, which are not all listed here. I have used C++, Java and JavaScript in them. One significant school project is the Antibiootit.fi website made in the Software Engineering Project 1 course, which is presented below. In addition to school projects and assignments, I have a few projects of my own.</p>

                    <h2>Antibiootit.fi</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://antibiootit.fi/" target="_blank">Antibiootit.fi</a> is an antibiotic calculator developed in the Software Engineering Project 1 course for use by healthcare professionals. It calculates the recommended antibiotic dosage based on the diagnosis and the child's weight.</p>
                    <p>In this project, I worked in the backend team, building a REST API for the website, using Java Spring Boot. I also took part in writing unit tests, project documentation and API documentation with Swagger. In addition, I implemented collecting the user inputs in the JavaScript frontend for research purposes.</p>

                    <h2>MenstrualApp</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://github.com/pampula/KuukautisApp" target="_blank">MenstrualApp</a> (or KuukautisApp in Finnish) is an Android application originally created for the Mobile development course, but I continued developing it further. It is a minimalistic application for monitoring and predicting menstrual cycles. It is in my active personal use, as the mobile apps in app stores contain too many needles features and ads. The program is written in Java.</p>

                    <h2>PomodoroApp</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://github.com/pampula/PomodoroApp" target="_blank">PomodoroApp</a> is a JavaFx desktop application, that provides a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique" target="_blank">pomodoro</a> timer for working and studying. It is inspired by the versions found online, but I wanted to have a custom desktop version of my own, that doesn't need internet to work.</p>
